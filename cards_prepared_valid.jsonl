Correlation does not necessarily describe cause and effect. In the last transition from ice age to our present climate, global temperature changed about 15 F. For CO2 to have caused this change, atmospheric levels of CO2 would have had to double at least three times to about 1,400 ppm. Ice-core studies show that during this period, CO2 levels increased from 180 ppm to 280 ppm. CO2 is very soluble in water, and a considerable amount is dissolved in our oceans, which cover about 70 percent of the planet\n\n###\n\n","completion":" m"}

Observation of the manner in which the climate at the surface of the Earth changes over time suggests that the effect of down-welling radiation is swamped by the mechanism described here. Historically the globe has warmed and cooled hemispheric-ally rather than monolithic-ally, a point that is lost on those who insist on a single global metric for temperature. The process is hemispheric-ally distinctive because it is driven at the poles. The atmosphere at the two poles is distinctively different, largely due to the very different distribution of land and sea between the hemispheres. It is the difference in the atmosphere between the poles that is important for the evolution of climate.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" d"}

{"prompt":"According to our result, the rapid warming during 1970-1990 contains a large fraction of unpredictable natural variability due to the AO. The subsequent period of 1990-2010 indicates a clear trend of the AO to be negative. The global warming has been stopped by natural variability superimposed on the gentle anthropogenic global warming. The important point is that the IPCC models have been tuned perfectly to fit the rapid warming during 1970-1990 by means of the ice-albedo feedback (anthropogenic forcing) which is not actually observed. IPCC models are justified with this wrong scientific basis and are applied to project the future global warming for 100 years in the future.

For example the ambiguity of whether they are conserving energy or energy flux, and the ambiguity of what happens if you take the incorrect approach.

When climate science refers to global average temperature, it is actually referring to a numerical value of +15C which corresponds to the average near-surface air temperature at an altitude of 1.5m above ground (not above sea-level) from a bunch of temperature stations randomly distributed around the planet. So this isnt a surface temperature and isnt global.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" b"}

That provides the dipole moment necessary for interaction with electromagnetic radiation. At very low atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 a large percentage of the available energy radiated by the Earth in this 14.77band is already affected leaving very little energy for increased CO 2 concentrations to affect.

Most important of all, the mean photosynthetic rate of plants growing in CO 2 -enriched and elevated-SO 2 air was 33.4% greater than the mean rate of plants growing in ambient-CO 2 and SO 2 -free air. Hence, enriching the air with CO 2 more than compensated for the negative effects of elevated SO 2 on photosynthesis rates of soybeans in this study. What it means\n\n###\n\n","completion":" f"}
{"prompt":"The easiest way for car makers to meet ever-rising CAFE standards has been through continued car downsizing. As the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration itself noted, \"weight reduction is probably the most powerful technique for improving fuel economy. . . . Each 10 percent reduction in weight improves the fuel economy of a new vehicle design by approximately 8 percent.\" The result was a CAFE-driven downsizing of approximately 500 pounds per car.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" b"}

{"prompt":"Is this the best solution? Certainly, tropical rainforests are a valuable ecological entity. \"They provide erosion and flood control, timber and forest products, medicines, wood fuel, outdoor `laboratories' for scientific research, and of course, a habitat for millions of plant and animal species. When developing these areas, it is important to formulate a biodiversity strategy with rational rules \" (Dartmouth Review, p.8) But that does not mean all-out preservation is the only answer.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" b"}
{"prompt":"In 1980, science writer Ron Bailey points out, the U.S. government thought we might have as many as 1,000 nuclear reactors up and running in the United States by now, instead of the 104 aging plants we do have. Our nuclearphobia led us to build hundreds of coal- and gas-fired power plants instead.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" b"}
{"prompt":"Most critically, EPA does not apply its judgment to the core scientific issueclimate sensitivity. If climate sensitivity is low, as investigations by Dr. Richard Linden (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Dr. William Gray (Colorado State University), and Dr. Roy Spencer (University of Alabama Huntsville) suggest, then 21st century warming is likely to be below the low-end (1.8 C) IPCC \"best estimate,\" and endangerment of public health and welfare is not \"reasonably anticipated.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" b"}

The ???information?? that the defendants had allegedly attempted to hide was the ???existence of the EPA inquiry?? and that his ???inquiry?? had been requested by CEI.
