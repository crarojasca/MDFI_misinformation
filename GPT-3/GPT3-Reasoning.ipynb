In a move that is likely to anger environmental groups, GMB signed a joint charter with UK Oil and Gas (UKOOG) which argues that gas is \"essential\" to British industry and households and will continue to play a key role in the UK's future energy mix. Gary Smith, GMB national secretary, said gas was a matter of national security. \"Our homes and large parts of British industry need gas; any suggestion to the contrary is just not real world,\" he said in a statement. -- Jessica Shankleman , BusinessGreen, 9 June 2015   \n",

       "28126  Compared with the likely benefits to both human health and food production from CO2-induced global warming, the possible disadvantages from, say, a slight increase in either the frequency or the intensity of extreme weather events is very small beer. It is, in fact, still uncertain whether there is any impact on extreme weather events as a result of warming (increased carbon emissions, which have certainly occurred, cannot on their own affect the weather: it is only warming which might). The unusual persistence of heavy rainfall over the UK during February, which led to considerable flooding, is believed by the scientists to have been caused by the wayward behaviour of the jetstream; and there is no credible scientific theory that links this behaviour to the fact that the earth's surface is some 0.8C warmer than it was 150 years ago.   \n",

While it is true that the Earth's climate has changed naturally in the past, the current climate change is not part of a natural cycle. Instead, it is being driven primarily by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which is trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. This is a very different process from the natural cycles that have caused climate change in the past.\n"
